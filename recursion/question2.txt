According to me out of S1, S2, S3 ; S3 is the best since it
uses a basic mathematical function to compute the result which
is more efficient, faster and much more cleaner to look at than
both S1 and S2. Both recursive function S1 and loops S2 has the 
complexity of O(n) where as S3 has a complexity of O(1). Therefore,
S3 uses lesser CPU time(or constant), doesnt consume enough memory
and is easier for the computer to evaluate even for large values.
